I made this to improve my software skills.

The most active sub-projects are "Cpu" and "Evolutionary Assembly".
yea so the cpu project is like a virtual machine thing i made to work with the evolution thing.

# Building
If you want to build this and try it out for yourself for some reason go ahead lol.
I'm new to cmake but I used it to as the make system and I guess you can figure it out.
