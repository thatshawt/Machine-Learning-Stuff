I made this to practice my programming and try to create something that really interests me, machine learning. 
Although my prefered language is Java, I'm still learning and c++ will have to do.
My main reasons for choosing C++ over Java for these projects was because it allows for more native interations
with the gpu, I want to learn about memory management, and because having C++ under my toolbelt is just good in 
general.

Project Description:
  Common:
  Contains one helper header with stuff that I reuse.

  Cpu:
  This contains an emulator for a cpu that exists purely for educational purposes and
  an assembler for said cpu.
  
  Evolutionary Assembly:
  This is my attempt on genetic programming using my emulator and assembler.
  
  Machine Learning Stuff:
  This is where I try to implement the Spiking Neuron and STDP learning.
  I want to eventually apply genetic algorithms to it somehow.
  
  Cellular Automata:
  I'm not sure if I'm going to pursue this project but it was going
  to be a framework for simulating cellular automata on a grid of any
  number of dimensions.
