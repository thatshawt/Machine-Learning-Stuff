I made this to practice my programming and try to create something that really interests me, machine learning. 
Although my prefered language is Java I'm still learning and c++ will have to do.
My main reasons for choosing C++ over Java for these projects was because it allows for more native interations
with the gpu, I want to learn about memory management, and because having C++ under my toolbelt is just good in 
general.
